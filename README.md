Click Sense: Predicting Ad-Click Behavior
Overview
Click Sense is a machine learning project aimed at predicting whether a user will click on an advertisement based on demographic and behavioral data. By leveraging models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting, this project uncovers actionable insights to optimize ad targeting and maximize ROI in digital marketing campaigns.

Project Highlights
Objective: Predict ad clicks to enhance targeted marketing strategies.
Key Models: Logistic Regression, SVM, Gradient Boosting.
Primary Findings: Logistic Regression provided the best balance of accuracy, precision, and interpretability, making it the optimal choice for this task.
Dataset
The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, contains 1,000 records with attributes such as:

Age
Area Income
Daily Internet Usage
Daily Time Spent on Site
Gender
Target variable: Clicked on Ad (Yes/No)
Data Preparation
Missing values: None.
Unnecessary columns removed: Ad Topic Line, Country, Timestamp, City.
Standardization applied to ensure feature scales are consistent.
Methodology
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Identified correlations between attributes like Age, Daily Time Spent on Site, and ad-click behavior.
Found older users are more likely to click on ads.
Model Selection:

Logistic Regression: High precision and interpretability; low false positive rate.
SVM: Captures complex relationships but less precise than Logistic Regression.
Gradient Boosting: Excels at capturing non-linear patterns but is computationally intensive.
Evaluation:

Logistic Regression achieved the best performance with 97.25% accuracy and a low false positive rate.
Challenges and Solutions
Data Scaling: Standardization improved model performance significantly, particularly for Logistic Regression and SVM.
Balancing Model Metrics: Focused on precision to reduce false positives and ensure efficient ad spending.
Key Insights
Age is the most significant factor influencing ad clicks.
Daily Time Spent on Site and Area Income also positively correlate with ad-click likelihood.
Simpler models like Logistic Regression can outperform more complex algorithms when data is well-prepared.
Future Scope
Implement advanced personalization to dynamically adapt ad content.
Conduct A/B testing for further optimization of ad placement and timing.
Expand the analysis to include deeper behavioral and geographic insights.
Use predictive analytics to improve ROI forecasting for ad campaigns.
